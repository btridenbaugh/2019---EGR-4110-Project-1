This application is a random color generator and a calculator.

For the random color generator just click the “Change Color” button to change the color of the 
text in the textfield. The text in the textfield is editable as well, so you can input 
any string value that you would like to test the font color generator on. Also
as a note, the RGB values of the color that has been selected will display at the 
top of the screen above the textfield. 

For the calculator you can click the buttons to add any numbers and operands
to a string that you would like to calculate. The orientation of the numbers and operands on the
calculator is based on currently existing calculators on the market.The calculator saves the whole 
equation that is to be calculated in the textfield that way it can be edited later. Also in the 
calculator are the buttons Enter, Clear, and Delete. Selecting the Enter button calculates
the equation in the text field. Clear, clear the string from the text field. And Delete, 
deletes the last item that was added to the textfield.
